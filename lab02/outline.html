<p>
<strong><em>Weekly quizzes:</em></strong> are short online quizzes completed at the beginning of your tutorial. See the Schedule above for the topics and dates of these quizzes. In general, they cover the material from the previous lectures and are closed books.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Lab exercises:</em></strong> In the tutorial, your tutor will review the completion of your completed lab exercises. You are encouraged to attempt to complete the set exercises before your tutorial so you have time to discuss any issues that arise with your tutor and have time to get them marked off.
</p>
<p>
<strong><em>Assignments: Parts 1, 2, and 3:</em></strong> are incremental installments of a website development task. In Part 1, you will demonstrate your ability to develop and deploy well-structured, linked Web pages with text, graphics, tables, and forms styled with CSS on a server. Part 2 further extends the use of HTML elements and makes use of JavaScript to validate forms and add dynamic behavior to the Web page. In Part 3 you will use forms to submit and retrieve data from a server using PHP and MySQL. 
</p>
