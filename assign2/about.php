                <p>I am from Vietnam. I grew up in Hanoi. That's our capital city. It is known for its centuries-old architecture and I love visiting historical places. I like visiting and exploring new places. I have visited China and India also. India has traces of the earliest civilization known to mankind. Additionally, I also enjoy fishing and playing musical instruments as well.</p>

                <p>I'm Adrien, I'm currently in my first year at SUT in my Bachelor of Computer Science (Cyber Security) degree. I've grown up in Melbourne and gained a passion for computer science through growing up with video games and reverse-engineering them. Iâ€™m working towards working in Digital Forensics in the future through my degree at Swinburne. I've worked on some projects providing graphics and art. I enjoy rock climbing or martial arts when I get the time. I enjoy reading books as well.</p>

                <p>Hi! I am Hizqeel. I am an international student here at Swinburne. It was a bit challenging in the beginning, and achieving work-study balance took some time, but it was really fun as there is professional help and assistance available every step of the way. I am originally from Chinot, Pakistan, which is well known for its furniture industry and exclusive designs. A few things that I find interesting include boxing and cycling, but I also like to tune my mind with a little music or by reading a good book.</p>

                <p>I am a first-semester student at Swinburne, studying the Bachelor of Computer Science. I am originally from China, and come from a coastal province rich for its tea production and culture. I moved to Australia at a young age and have had the privilege of residing in both Queensland and Melbourne. Beyond my academic pursuits, I have an interest in aviation and have completed my RPL flight training before pursuing Computer science. I also happen to be a qualified barista, who enjoys exploring Melbourne's diverse cafe culture during weekends. As for music, I enjoy listening to Korean and Chinese R&B.</p>
